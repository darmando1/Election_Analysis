## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used to calculate numerous data sets and percentages. Depending on what type of data is provided in the input file, the script can be modified to calculate a wide range of values. For example, one calculation could be based on the total votes each county had for each candidate. If we had the data regarding candidate affiliation (Democrat, Republican, or Independent) we could see the distribution of votes by county and identify whether the county leaned towards a specific political party. Likewise, on a macro level, we could see on a state level how many counties were traditionally Republican, Democrat, or did not have a historical pattern of either.
